# Baba Is You Patashu's Mods

Modding Baba is You for practice. I'll add more mods in future probably.

To install: Extract the "Scripts" and "Sprites" folders into the world you wish to use the mod with. **Make sure lilybeeveeeeee's modloader is installed! (in pins)** Check Scripts/options.lua to enable or disable features!

**LESS** - __Property__ The opposite of MORE. If an object *could* expand to surrounding tiles under MORE rules, then it is destroyed.

**SLIDE** - __Property__ Whenever this object moves, it moves as far as possible. Tested with you, move, shift, push and pull. 'ALL on ICE is SLIDE'  makes ice slippery!

**STUCK** - __Property__ This object cannot be moved by any means (tested: SHIFT, PUSH, PULL, SWAP, MOVE, YOU, FALL). Conditional STUCK can be used to stop movement on certain tiles.

**TOPPLE** - __Property__ When a stack of topplers are on a tile, they eject themselves in the facing direction to form a line (first moves 0 tiles, second moves 1 tile, third moves 2 tiles, etc).

**PHASE** - __Property__ If something would normally block your movement (STOP, an impossible PUSH or PULL) then with PHASE you can walk through it anyway.

**MULTIPLY / DIVIDE** - __Property__ X shaped counterparts to MORE and LESS, growing and shrinking in checkerboard patterns.

**FACEAWAY / FACESIDE** - __Condition (Prefix)__ Counterparts to FACING that check your back and your sides respectively.

**SINGLET / CAPPED / STRAIGHT / CORNER / EDGE / INNER** - __Condition (Prefix) True for objects that are surrounded by themselves on 0/1/2 (straight)/2 (corner)/3/4 sides, respectively. Useful for creating multi-tile substances like DROD Tar and Mud.
