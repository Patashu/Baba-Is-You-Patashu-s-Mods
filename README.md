# Baba Is You Patashu's Mods

Modding Baba is You for practice. I'll add more mods in future probably.

To install: Extract the "Scripts" and "Sprites" folders into the world you wish to use the mod with. **Make sure lilybeeveeeeee's modloader is installed! (in pins)** Check Scripts/options.lua to enable or disable features!

**LESS** - __Verb__ The opposite of MORE. If an object *could* expand to surrounding tiles under MORE rules, then it is destroyed.
**SLIDE** - __Verb__ Whenever this object moves, it moves as far as possible. Tested with you, move, shift, push and pull. 'ALL on ICE is SLIDE'  makes ice slippery!
**STUCK** - __Verb__ This object cannot be moved by any means (tested: SHIFT, PUSH, PULL, SWAP, MOVE, YOU, FALL). Conditional STUCK can be used to stop movement on certain tiles.
