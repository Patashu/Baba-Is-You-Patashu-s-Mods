# Baba Is You Patashu's Mods

Modding Baba is You for practice. I'll add more mods in future probably.

To install: Extract the "Scripts" and "Sprites" folders into the world you wish to use the mod with. **Make sure lilybeeveeeeee's modloader is installed! (in pins)** Check Scripts/options.lua to enable or disable features!

**LESS** - __Verb__ The opposite of MORE. If an object *could* expand to surrounding tiles under MORE rules, then it is destroyed.
